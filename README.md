This project explores the Titanic dataset through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), identifying survival patterns among passengers based on features such as gender, age, class, fare, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Objectives

- Handle missing values and duplicates
- Analyze survival distribution by gender, passenger class, age, fare, and embarkation
- Create new derived features (e.g., family members)
- Use visualizations to identify patterns in survival rates

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Google Colab** (Python Notebook)
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ Visualization

---

## ðŸ“Š EDA Highlights

- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers had the highest chance of survival.
- Passengers embarking from Cherbourg (C) had better survival rates.
- High fare correlated with higher survival.
- Families with fewer members showed better survival trends.
